It's pretty simple and based on the fact that each 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row on Sudoku grid should contain numbers from 1 to 9 and each number can be used only once within 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row.\n\nTherefore, if we see that there is only one free cell left in the 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row, then we have to define which number from 1 to 9 is missing and enter it in this empty cell.\n\nYou can see how it looks in the examples below.",
