Welcome to Sudoku, the ultimate brain-teasing puzzle game designed to challenge and entertain Sudoku lovers of all skill levels! Whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned Sudoku expert looking for a challenge, this app is perfect for you.

## What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a classic logic-based number puzzle where players must fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that no number repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. Itâ€™s a game of strategy, patience, and logical thinking that provides endless hours of fun!

## How to play

<ol>
    <li>Each row contains the numbers 1 to 9, without repetition.</li>
    <li>Each column contains the numbers 1 to 9, without repetition.</li>
    <li>Each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9, without repetition.</li>
</ol>

#### Step-by-Step Guide

<ul>
    <li><b>Start with Given Numbers</b><br/>Each puzzle begins with some numbers already placed on the grid. These are your clues!</li>
    <li><b>Use Logic to Fill Empty Cells</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Find a number that can only fit in one spot based on the given clues.</li>
        <li>Check the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to ensure no duplicates.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Use the "Note Mode"</b><br/>If youâ€™re unsure about a number, write down small notes in empty cells to track possibilities.</li>
    <li><b>Look for Patterns & Eliminate Possibilities</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>If a number is missing in a row, column, or box, try to determine where it must go.</li>
        <li>Use techniques like Single Candidates, Naked Pairs, and X-Wing (advanced strategies).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Keep Going Until the Grid is Complete!</b><br/>If you get stuck, use hints or advance note</li>
</ul>
